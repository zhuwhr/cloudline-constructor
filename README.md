# cloudline-constructor

This is a tool of constructing cloudline, which is a fantastic visualization technique proposed [here](https://bib.dbvis.de/uploadedFiles/356.pdf).

I plan to make it a useful library. Ideally people can use it and draw an actual cloudline with time series data. By now I am building an actual cloud line chart.

A good example of real time data visualization can be found [here](https://bl.ocks.org/boeric/6a83de20f780b42fadb9). My work could be on top of this one.
